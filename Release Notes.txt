KNAppGuide Release Notes
========================

Version 0.2 (Released Wednesday, May 20th, 2009)
================================================

 -	KNAppGuideBasicKVCResolver now loads an NSViewController's view if it encounters 
	one while resolving key paths. This improves resolving behaviour when referencing 
	controls that are referenced by view controllers that haven't had their views displayed
	yet.
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter now supports tags in step explanations, to allow step text to 
	automatically reflect the UI. The tags are:
		- %NEXTBUTTONTITLE 
		- %PREVIOUSBUTTONTITLE
		- %DONEBUTTONTITLE
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter no longer crashes if you double-click the done button fast enough
	to click it again as the window is fading out.
	
 -	KNAppGuide[ClickButton/EnterText/EnterDate]Action no longer perform their actions if the 
	target control is disabled - they return kAppGuideActionFailed instead.

 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter no longer allows presenting a nil guide. If you try to call 
	initWithGuide: with nil, you'll get nil back and nothing will happen.
	
 -	KNAppGuideDelegate protocol messages are now optional.

 -	Added -(void)guide:(id <KNAppGuide>)aGuide action:(id <KNAppGuideAction>)anAction wasPerformedForStep:(id <KNAppGuideStep>)step; 
	delegate method to KNAppGuideDelegate protocol.
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter now automatically closes the guide when the action on the last step 
	is performed by either the user or by clicking "Show Me". This prevents highlights remaining
	when performing the last step removes a control from view (like dismissing a sheet). 
	
 -	KNAppGuideClickButtonAction no longer posts a KVO notification for hasBeenPerformed before it 
	performs its action. This would cause the presenter to move onto the next step prematurely 
	when "Show Me" was clicked, possibly causing havoc if the next step depends on the button
	being pushed.
