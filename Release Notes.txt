KNAppGuide Release Notes
========================

Version 0.3.2
=============

 -	Added German and Spanish localizations to KNAppGuideHUDPresenter.

Version 0.3.1 (Released Friday, May 29th, 2009)
=============================================

 -	The KNAppGuidePresenter protocol now has a read-only -window property. It's OK for this
	to return nil.

 -	KNAppGuideClassicHighlight +highlightForView now checks if the given view belongs to a window.
 
 -	Added French localization to KNAppGuideHUDPresenter.

 -	Corrected license terms slightly.

Version 0.3 (Released Monday, May 25th, 2009)
=============================================

 -	You can now highlight menu items in the app's mainMenu. To do so,
	set a step's highlighted item to the menu item the user should choose. 
	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter will do the right thing. Create a KNAppGuideClickButtonAction
	with the menu item and the framework will perform the item's action when needed
	and notice when it's been chosen by the user. 
 
 -	KNAppGuideClickButtonAction will now attempt to send the 
	button's -action down the responder chain if the button's
	target is set to nil.
	
 -	Added a new delegate method to the KNAppGuidePresenterDelegate protocol:
	-(NSString *)presenter:(id <KNAppGuidePresenter>)aPresenter willDisplayExplanation:(NSString *)anExplanation forStep:(id <KNAppGuideStep>)aStep inGuide:(id <KNAppGuide>)aGuide;

	If you implement this, the presenter will use the returned string when displaying the step rather than the string 
	contained in the step. The proposed step explanation string is contained in anExplanation with any built-in
	tags (%NEXTBUTTONTITLE, %PREVIOUSBUTTONTITLE, %DONEBUTTONTITLE) already replaced with the final values. You might
	use this method to implement your own app-specific tags. For example, I use this in the Clarus application to give 
	"This area contains Chester's insurance policies..." instead of "This area contains your pet's insurance policies...".

Version 0.2 (Released Wednesday, May 20th, 2009)
================================================

 -	KNAppGuideBasicKVCResolver now loads an NSViewController's view if it encounters 
	one while resolving key paths. This improves resolving behaviour when referencing 
	controls that are referenced by view controllers that haven't had their views displayed
	yet.
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter now supports tags in step explanations, to allow step text to 
	automatically reflect the UI. The tags are:
		- %NEXTBUTTONTITLE 
		- %PREVIOUSBUTTONTITLE
		- %DONEBUTTONTITLE
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter no longer crashes if you double-click the done button fast enough
	to click it again as the window is fading out.
	
 -	KNAppGuide[ClickButton/EnterText/EnterDate]Action no longer perform their actions if the 
	target control is disabled - they return kAppGuideActionFailed instead.

 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter no longer allows presenting a nil guide. If you try to call 
	initWithGuide: with nil, you'll get nil back and nothing will happen.
	
 -	KNAppGuideDelegate protocol messages are now optional.

 -	Added -(void)guide:(id <KNAppGuide>)aGuide action:(id <KNAppGuideAction>)anAction wasPerformedForStep:(id <KNAppGuideStep>)step; 
	delegate method to KNAppGuideDelegate protocol.
	
 -	KNAppGuideHUDPresenter now automatically closes the guide when the action on the last step 
	is performed by either the user or by clicking "Show Me". This prevents highlights remaining
	when performing the last step removes a control from view (like dismissing a sheet). 
	
 -	KNAppGuideClickButtonAction no longer posts a KVO notification for hasBeenPerformed before it 
	performs its action. This would cause the presenter to move onto the next step prematurely 
	when "Show Me" was clicked, possibly causing havoc if the next step depends on the button
	being pushed.
